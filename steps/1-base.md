# Phase 1 - Basic Setup
In this step, we will prepare the skeleton of the application.

## Task  - Copy the template
In this repo, you fill found `care-sync-base`.  You can copy it, or just make you changes in it.

Find the React Components. Try changing and adding code. Change the title to your own title.

> Did you found App.txs? Header.tsx? If you want to know more about the structre of those component - just copy-paste and ask chat-GPT! ðŸ¤“

# Template of a create-react-app Project

When you create a new `create-react-app` project, it will come with the following files and directories:

## Public

The `public` directory contains the static assets of your application, such as the HTML file, images, and other files that will be served directly by the web server. The `index.html` file is the main HTML file that is loaded when the application is launched.

## Src

The `src` directory is where you will place your application source code. This is where you will create React components, define styles, and write application logic. The `index.js` or `index.tsx` file is the main entry point of your application.

## index.js / index.tsx

The `index.js` or `index.tsx` file is the main entry point of your application. It is responsible for rendering the root React component and mounting it to the DOM. This file imports the `App` component from `App.js` or `App.tsx`.

## tsconfig.json

The `tsconfig.json` file is a configuration file for the TypeScript compiler. It defines the settings that the compiler will use to compile your TypeScript code to JavaScript. If you chose to create your `create-react-app` project using TypeScript, this file will be present by default. If you created a JavaScript project, this file won't be present by default.

That's the basic template of a `create-react-app` project.
